# CommandLineConnect4
NodeJs command line Connect4

My wife asked me how long it would take me to code Connect4, and I said 3 houors.  Thankfully, it only took 90 minutes. It identifies when a game has been won or drawn, and allows players to enter in their own colors at their own risk.

HOW DO I START?

get node
run file usind node from a terminal.
Each player enters in their color of choice, then each player takes turns saying what column they want to drop their tile into. Make sure your command line window is large enough for printing to not be impeded!

Add issues if you find a bug! Thanks.
